## 🚀 About Me 
An experienced Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience in fintech and healthcare startups, I specialize in SQL and Python to extract insights and drive data-informed decision-making. I leverage data visualization tools like Looker and Tableau to transform complex data into compelling narratives.

I have a proactive approach to identifying and sourcing the right data to solve business challenges, optimize processes, and enhance decision-making systems. Beyond analytics, I’m deeply interested in Data Engineering and Data Science—building scalable data pipelines, automating workflows, and applying machine learning to unlock deeper insights.
